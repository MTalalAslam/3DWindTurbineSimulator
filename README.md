# 3DWindTurbineSimulator
a 3D Simulator that can design a wind farm by PSO technique in a continuous space, as well as can design in Grid base wind farm layout. The simulator will provide 3D environment system and control with simulated values, simulation of wake effect and air flow in the environment and present simulation results into graphical format that can be used in future for analysis
